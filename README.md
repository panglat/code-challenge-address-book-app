This is a fictional address book app, where you can search for users addresses and
personal information. The app displays a list of users for clients to browse and get
personal information for a selected user.

## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
